# Task2: Namsor API README

## Introduction

This project aims to utilize the Namsor API documentation, a name checking technology, to analyze a list of first and last names stored in an Excel sheet. The responses for each name will be saved in separate text files with the format firstname_lastname.txt. The "Ethnicity" and "EthnicityAlt" fields from the API response will be added as new columns to the initial fields in the Excel file. Finally, the updated dataset will be saved and exported as File_Name_updated.xlsx.
